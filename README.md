# Oil Price Forecasting with Deep Learning

Forecasting short-term oil prices is a critical challenge in energy economics, with implications for trading, policy, and risk management. This project demonstrates the use of deep learning‚Äîspecifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks‚Äîto model and forecast crude oil returns using macro-financial indicators.

The pipeline integrates multiple data sources, applies robust preprocessing and feature engineering, and builds a predictive model optimized for capturing temporal dependencies in financial time series.

## Contents

- **Notebook**: A Jupyter notebook that walks through the full pipeline‚Äîfrom data collection and transformation to model training and evaluation.
- **Feature Engineering**: Includes log returns, volatility metrics, and lag structures crafted from macroeconomic indicators.
- **Modeling**: Sequence-to-one prediction using LSTM layers trained on windowed time series data.
- **Evaluation**: Multi-horizon forecasts visualized alongside realized returns and prices; metrics include RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤.
